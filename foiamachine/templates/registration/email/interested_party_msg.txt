Dear {{firstname}} {{lastname}},

The FOIA Machine team is hard at work planning, building and developing the many ideas we've discussed with all of you.

Funding is essential for FOIA Machine to reach its full potential. We have submitted a proposal to the highly competitive Knight Foundation Open Government News Challenge, and you can help. The Knight Foundation has emphasized that community support is a key factor they evaluate in selecting winners.

Here's three things you can do today (by following this link)

https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/foia-machine-citizens-and-journalists-platform-for-public-record-requests/ 


1.) "Applaud" the FOIA Machine proposal, using the button at the bottom of the proposal


2.) Comment on the proposal with support or, just as importantly, feedback on what we can improve


3.) Share the proposal with your social media friends, asking them to offer support or feedback as well


With more than 350 of you signed up to use the platform, we know that there is a committed group of users ready to help make FOIA Machine a valuable resource. Help us show the Knight Foundation how strong that support is. 

Feel free to reach out to us with comments or questions at info@foiamachine.info or at our Google users group
